## Instructor: [Andrew Burgess][instructor url]


React is a flexible framework that makes it easy to build single-page web applications. One of its tools is a set of lifecycle methods which you can add to your components. These methods are called at different stages in the life of a component, and they make it possible to manage your component's changing state and resources.

In this course, you'll take a look at each of React's seven lifecycle methods and see how they can work together to create dynamic React components.
